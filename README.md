 # SmartVendingMachine-Project
This project is supporting the ISV who's provider of Smart Vending Machine solution in chinar,help to develop a way to monitor the working status of its machines and to get real-time information on replenishment needs.

- Pain Point
To date, this ISV has no solution that can monitor vending machine health status or get real-time information on whether a device is working. Any device needing attention usually requires two onsite visitsâ€”once to diagnose the issue and again to return with the component to fix the issue. All this adds to the cost of maintaining the machines. And also, their goods manager must check on the selling status of the vending machines to see if they need replenishing.
